               <h4>Background</h4>
            </div>
            <p class="about-para align">I was homeschooled in a small town in the South so upon moving to the Middle East after high school to do some soul searching, I quickly learned how to step outside of my comfort zone and embrace life’s daily curveballs. I befriended a girl named Tahini, a patient at the hospital where I was volunteering who was my age, and the language barrier became a game for us as we forged a friendship while she was healing. I learned that there are so many ways to communicate and that’s what I loved when I first started researching design -  everything we do in design is about communicating with our users! Kindness, listening, and companionship are such assets during pain, and don't we all struggle with pain in some way?</p>
            <p class="about-para align">When I returned to the states I began my career in healthcare where I learned how to respond to any situation, no matter the language. As  I continued my healthcare work, I was still searching for more so since I love making people laugh and have never shied away from risk, I naturally applied to the Second City’s highly competitive Conservatory program. Now, remember, I’m just a small-town girl from Tennessee who rolled the dice on a program that draws comedians from around the world. So you can imagine my shock when I received my acceptance letter. As I settled into the Windy City, I never forgot how my friendship with Tahini blossomed out of mutual curiosity, exploration, and trust. I built relationships with friends and colleagues, learning that it is, in fact, okay to be yourself. Growing up in a homogeneous rural town, being unapologetically “you” was a privilege only a few people had. Second City taught me how to listen, connect, and, most importantly, how to bring my whole self to the table.</p>

               <h4>Why Design?</h4>
            </div>
            <p class="about-para align">After 13 years in healthcare, I saw the industry move away from patient-centered care and it was heartbreaking. I started asking myself: How can I use my passion, skills, and experience to communicate and solve problems outside of the patient/therapist setting. UX design hit the mark in all areas for me and has me chomping at the bit to continue changing the world!</p>
            <p class="about-please align">Please reach out! I love getting to know people and talking about design, travel, comedy, food, whiskey, dogs... and the list goes on and on</p>
