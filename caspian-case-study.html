It was humbling to need to exchange the visual design I had planned for the one that was chosen through user testing and I learned that this particular blow caused me to interview and re-test to understand the reasons behind the choice. Not a bad response! Caspian offered me some wonderful lessons and growths as I started this new adventure in design so I can only imagine the experiences waiting up ahead.</p>
