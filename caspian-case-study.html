              <h2>Summary</h2>
              <p>The cloud storage world is vast but still has some beautiful areas of improvement. I created Caspian to offer solutions to simplify, organize, and add community to the user’s experience. </p>
              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>The areas of improvement for cloud storage apps were keeping files organized, storage space, and a difficulty sharing files</p>
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>By simplifying the site navigation, streamlining the organization process, and adding community, the use is more pleasing to the user’s experience.</p>

              <p>In order to discover what the users wanted or needed, I created a survey to focus on the identified problems to ensure I was headed down the right path</p>
              <h4>What do surveyors use cloud storage for?</h4>
              <p>~ Pictures</p>
              <p>~ Videos</p>
              <p>~ Work/school projects</p>
              <p>~ Creating content in the cloud</p>
              <h4>What do surveyors like about their apps?</h4>
              <p>~ The price</p>
              <p>~ Storage options</p>
              <p>~ Can use for work and personal</p>
              <h4>What bugs them about cloud storage services?</h4>

              <p>Researching the competition and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses was a vital next step. The three companies chosen were Google Drive, iCloud and Dropbox which may seem a bit obvious, but their corner on the market made them necessary to study</p>

                  <h5>Motivations</h5>
                  <p>Megan is a busy entrepreneur who is taking photography classes to further pursue the hobby she’s enjoyed since college. She’s very organized and grateful to be able to make her own schedule so she can spend time with her husband, Mark and dog, Charlie. She is frustrated with her current choices for safe cloud storage because her clients don’t always have the devices needed to access her data which means she has data saved in multiple locations and her mom still can’t figure out how to download some of Charlie’s picture from the “Charlie” folder in the cloud.</p>
                  <h5>Frustrations</h5>
                  <p>~ Lack of accessibility for her clients</p>
                  <p>~ Difficulty sharing files</p>

                    <p>Ken is an adventurous guy who loves traveling and trying new cuisines. He’s started a blog about his experiences but has storage issues with his current cloud provider and doesn’t have the funds to spend paying for more storage. He’s willing to switch providers from someone who can offer more storage, for a reasonable price.</p>
                    <h5>Frustrations</h5>
                    <p>~ Pictures take longer to load now that he’s getting low on storage</p>

                  <h1>Visual Design</h1>
                  <h2>Brand Characteristics</h2>
                  <p>Since the client was vague about what they wanted for branding, I began playing around with the creation of personality and emotions and found that there were four adjectives that described this brand</p>
                  <h2>Deep</h2>
                  <h2>Dramatic</h2>
                  <h2>Controlled</h2>
                  <h2>Powerful</h2>
                  <img src="images/caspian-case-study/branding/cloud.png" alt="cloud">
                  <p>These adjectives led to searching for an emotional image of the sky and then a color palette that would compliment and define the brand that was taking form.</p>

                  <h2>Name</h2>
                  <p>Through some mind mapping I arrived at the name Caspian. Caspian it’s strong and an older name that draws from the adjectives helping strengthen the brand</p>

                  <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
                  <p>Before finalizing a prototype I ran a quick preference test to see if the users would prefer a more visually dramatic app or a more simplistic look.</p>
                  <h4>Dashboard A</h4>
                  <img src="images/caspian-case-study/preference-testing/dashboard-a.png" alt="dashboard a">

                  <p>This was actually not the design I was planning to use so I was a little resistant at first but the testing results don’t lie so it was an opportunity for learning, letting go, and moving forward.</p>

                    <p>Caspian was a wild ride. It was humbling to need to exchange the visual design I had planned for the one that was chosen through user testing and I learned that this particular blow caused me to interview and re-test to understand the reasons behind the choice. Not a bad response! Caspian offered me some wonderful lessons and growths as I started this new adventure in design so I can only imagine the experiences waiting up ahead.</p>
