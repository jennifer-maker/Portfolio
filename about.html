            <h1>The Complexities of Jen</h1>
            <p class="welcome">
              It’s been a wild ride as a small-town southern gal who’s journey has allowed her to define her character in the middle east, assemble courage in comedy and discover purpose in design.

            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p class="background">
              I was homeschooled in a small town in the south so upon moving to the Middle East after high school to do some soul searching, I quickly learned how to step outside of my comfort zone and embrace life’s daily curveballs. I befriended a girl named Tahini, a patient who was my age, and the language barrier became a game as we forged a friendship while she was healing. There are so many ways to communicate and that’s what I loved when I first started researching design -  everything we do in design is communicating with our users! Kindness, listening, and companionship are such assets during pain, and aren’t we all struggling with pain in some way?

              When I returned to the states I began my career in healthcare where I learned how to respond to any situation, no matter the language. As  I continued my healthcare work, I was still searching for more so since I love making people laugh and have never shied away from risk, I naturally applied to the Second City’s highly competitive Conservatory program. Now, remember, I’m just a small-town girl from Tennessee who rolled the dice on a program that draws comedians from around the world. So you can imagine my shock when I received my acceptance letter. As I settled into the Windy City, I never forgot how my friendship with Tahini blossomed out of mutual curiosity, exploration, and trust. I built relationships with friends and colleagues, learning that it is, in fact, okay to be yourself. Growing up in a homogeneous rural town, being unapologetically “you” was a privilege only a few people had. Second City taught me how to listen, connect, and, most importantly, how to bring my whole self to the table.

            <h1>Why Design?</h1>
            <p>
              After 13 years in healthcare, I had watched the industry move away from patient-centered care and it was heartbreaking. I started asking myself: How can I use my passions, skills, and experience to communicate and solve problems outside of the patient/therapist setting. UX design hit the mark in all areas for me and has me chomping at the bit to continue changing the world!
